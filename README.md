# RepoViewerv2

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.3.

This is an effort to improve my first angular application by completely re-writing it. Rather than nesting components I have gone for a siblings approach and used and EventEmitter for sharing variables. This may possibly change as I am actively making changes and want to split the component views into 2 routes for cases when the repos/commits go on for too long joined together.
